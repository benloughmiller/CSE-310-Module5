# Overview

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
This is a simple platformer game in which you try to reach the yellow gate in each level. You move your character with the arrow keys and jump with the spacebar. Green platforms are safe to jump on, while red ones will kill you. If you touch the orange powerup, you get to jump again in the air using the space bar. There are 3 levels for you to complete!

My purpose for writing this software is to show an example of how Python and the Pygame library can be used in game creation.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to develop the program, and BFXR to develop the sound effects. The game was written in Python with the Pygame library used for the framework, and the Time library used for keeping track of time in-game.

# Future Work

* Add a main menu to start the game/adjust settings
* Add more levels to the game
* Add an ending screen when the game is completed
